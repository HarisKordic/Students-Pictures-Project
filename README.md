**Project description:**

This is a small Windows Form desktop application built with .NET 8.0 framework. My goal was to build a sustainable and fully functional application, where the main focus is on implementing basic CRUD functionallities.

For communicating with the  database I used a NuGet package called SQL.ES6 and for the managment of the same, I used an app called "DB browser for SQLite".

_P.S. If you have any comments regarding the latest build,  please open a new issue and let me know :D_

1.0 ~ Intro screen:
      In this starting dialog you can find my contact information such as mail and a link to my github account. The dialog itself is very simple as it's main purpose is to start the program.

2.0 ~ Main view:
      This dialog shows two  data grid view controls showcasing the students recorded in the database, students and their passed subjects, as well as two search boxes where the user can search and filter students via the name and       surname, or search subjects via their name.
