**Project description:**

This is a small Windows Form desktop application built with .NET 8.0 framework. My goal was to build a sustainable and fully functional application, where the main focus is on implementing basic CRUD functionallities.

For communicating with the  database I used a NuGet package called SQL.ES6 and for the managment of the same, I used an app called "DB browser for SQLite".

_P.S. If you have any comments regarding the latest build,  please open a new issue and let me know :D_
